# inform-gen

This is a public repo for my procedurally generated (proc-gen) inform project. It was created in November 2017, with the intent to submit it to #NaNoGenMo and ProcJam.

There is more detail here: https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017/issues/89 ...as well as on my blog here: http://chesstris.com/2017/12/04/procjam-and-nanogenmo-postmortem/


# install / requirements

You'll need/want to install these python modules:

* pytracery - https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery
* pycorpa - https://github.com/aparrish/pycorpora

You'll also need Inform7, get it at http://inform7.com

After installing Inform, you'll need to install at least the Exit Lister extension by Gavin Lambert. (You can install extensions by going to `File->Install Extension...`)

Then simply run the file `game.py` to generate your inform program, and copy/paste it into Inform7. If there is time, I'd like to see if I can get that step to happen automagically, but it's not there yet.


# output directory

In the output directory you'll find runs that I felt made significant progress, or I thought just had funny / interesting content. I'll name them sequentially.
